// Discovers every published @axonpack package from npm and writes src/generated/packages.json.
//
// Nothing here is hand-listed: publish a package and the next build picks it up; unpublish one and
// it disappears. That also enforces the repo rule that only shipped packages appear on the site,
// because npm is the only source consulted.
//
// Two sources are unioned on purpose:
//   * search?text=@axonpack   carries description/keywords/date, but its index lags a fresh publish
//   * /-/org/axonpack/package is immediate, but lists everything the account can write, so it needs
//                               filtering to the scope
// GitHub's contents API is deliberately NOT used: it reflects the default branch, so a package
// merged but unpublished would appear, and one published from a branch would not.
//
// No dependencies. Node 20+ has fetch.

// --- releases, parsed out of each library's Changesets CHANGELOG.md ------------------------------

// Changesets writes a stable shape: "## <version>" per release, then "### Patch|Minor|Major

// changelog is the only place the release prose exists. npm carries versions and dates but no
// notes, so the two get joined below.

// Served straight out of the published npm tarball, pinned to the exact version, not from the
// GitHub repo. That is both npm-only and more correct: it is the changelog that actually shipped,
// rather than whatever the default branch happens to hold. It also works for a package published
// from a branch, which the repo route could not see at all.
